            I am a current Master of Data Science student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute set to graduate in December of 2017. The role of a Data Scientist is simple to state yet difficult to put into practice; that is <b>create value from data</b>. The tools to create such value, in recent years, have become robust and very efficient. However, these tools also have become increasingly high in volume and complexity. My philosophy is as such: continuously expand my depth of knowledge in fundamental theory and algorithms while advancing my breadth in their numerous applications. 
<br><br>
Through my studies and work experience, I have delved into the mathematical and computational workings of various <b>Machine Learning</b> methodologies (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement), <b>Natural Language Processing</b> techniques (sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, text mining, etc.), and <b>Big Data Management</b> (SQL/NoSQL database structures, data pipelines, etc.). I have put these methodologies into practice over the years while-list experimenting with various software and programming tools to better understand their pros, cons, and overall capabilities.

                <br>
                <p id="content" class="wow animated fadeInUp"><b>(2017-Present)</b> - <a href="https://www.redhorsecorp.com/">Redhorse Corporation (RH)</a> is an integrated solutions provider with expertise in areas such as energy, I.T., and intelligence. Alike many dynamic corporations, identifying both internal and external top-tier talent is an ongoing and everchanging task for RH. During my time as a Junior Data Scientist with the company, I helped develop their proprietary Talent Management System (TMS). Of course, I cannot go into specifics; however, during my time there I began to theorize a framework to perform on-the-fly talent matching to arbitrary project descriptions. This framework leverages the recently developed fastText library by the Facebook AI Research (FAIR) team.
                    <br>
                    <br>                                         
                    <center><img src="img/fastText.jpg" width="40%"></center>                                       
                    <br> <a href="https://research.fb.com/fasttext/">FAIR's fastText library</a> is for efficient learning of word representations and sentence classification through Continuous Bag-of-Words and Continuous Skip-grams. In essence, words are mapped to vectors such that, given a distance metric, words closer together are closer in semantic meaning. Generally, such a model conducts text classification (with a pre-defined set of categories) through simple linear models where averaged word representations or features are said to be representative of a document.
                    <br>
                    <br> I purpose two changes to this text classification method. One, when building features to represent a document, simply averaging word representations does not necessarily capture the ‘essence’ of a document. Other functions can be created that better fuse words, and take data such as TF-IDF into account as well. Two, text classification with pre-defined categories is lackluster when documents are required to be placed into dynamic groups. In RH’s case, new project descriptions (PDs) are generated daily by various clients. It is up to RH to identify talent that can fulfill these PDs quickly and efficiently.                                              
                    <br>
                                                                   <br> One can handle this task by converting a PD into a series of vectors representative of the described skills, taking a corpus of word embeddings representative of various talent’s documents (resumes, CVs, profiles, etc.), and computing the distances between various talents and PD representations. This forgoes semi-static classification techniques in favor of unique comparisons to be made by each new PD. fastText is not only a fast and efficient method to generate these word embeddings for a company’s needs, but FAIR recently released pre-trained word vector models for <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/blob/master/pretrained-vectors.md">294 languages</a> trained using Deep ANNs over Wikipedia! 
                    <br>
                                                                   <br> Currently I am familiarizing myself with the open-source <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">ML TensorFlow library</a> for Python in order to conduct transfer learning more efficiently from FAIR’s pre-trained models. Once I am confident, I hope to continue my personal work to develop my own talent matching system.

                <br>
                <p id="content" class="wow animated fadeInUp"><b>(2016-2017)</b> - Highway tolls generate revenue to support the construction and long term maintenance of public
roadways. While tollbooths are necessary, their limited capacity can create major traffic pinch points,
especially so in densely populated urban transit networks. Understanding how car volume changes
through these gates and the underlying factors responsible for the change can assist transit authorities
in better handling high volume events and guided them toward needed precautionary or auxiliary
measures. This was the premise of the <a href="http://www.kdd.org/kdd2017/News/view/announcing-kdd-cup-2017-highway-tollgates-traffic-flow-prediction">2017 KDD Cup</a> organized by Alibaba Cloud. 
                    <br>
                    <br> Two colleague data scientists and myself set-off to tackle one of two sub-competitions of the cup; namely <a href="https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/information.htm?spm=5176.100067.5678.2.8CnCPt&raceId=231597">Traffic Volume Prediction</a>. Given a route, direction, and tollgate triplet, the task was to predict the number of vehicles passing through within a series of 20-minute time intervals throughout a three-month period. Only data from previous time-intervals can be used to estimate any given time-interval.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <br>We converted the volumes into a 20-minute time series through time-series segmentation via various sliding windows. The group tested several different Machine Learning algorithms to minimize Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Algorithms tried included: SVM, Linear Regression, Random Forest and ANNs supported by various pre-processing techniques such as K-Means clustering. In addition, we utilized different types of meta-learning techniques such as Stacking and Bagging.

                <br>
                <p id="content" class="wow animated fadeInUp"><b>(2016)</b> - Today we live in the big data age. Due to the increasing use of web and cloud based services, as well as advances in computer and sensor technology, a wealth of new data is being gathered throughout academia, business, and the government. My Major Qualifying Project (MQP) titled Machine Learning Applications was written to both explore the various ways Machine Learning (ML) is used to process this big data, and develop, from scratch, my own ML application. 
                    <br>
                    <br>While completing my undergraduate degree in the Mathematical Sciences, I became intrigued by statistical and linear algebra based methods for dimensionality reduction on large datasets. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) thus became the foundation for my MQP. PCA is one feature extraction method that derives a low-dimensional uncorrelated set of features from a large set of correlated variables. If used correctly, PCA can significantly reduce the dimensionality, and therefore memory, while retaining nearly all of the variance of a dataset.
                    <br>
                    <center><img src="img/mqp_sim.png" width="60%"></center>
                    <br> In recent history, several organizations have been utilizing dimensionality techniques to store, access, and analyze their collected data more efficiently and with increased speed. I researched companies from Google and their AdWords platform to The National Center for Biotechnology Information and their GenBank work. The application that I wanted to ‘mimic’ from the ground up, however, was that of Netflix’s movie recommendation system. Thus, I created my own small scale recommendation system in MATLAB tested over movie rating datasets ranging from 100K to 1M ratings from the MovieLens repository.
                    <br>
                    <br> For those with a more mathematical background, I conducted PCA through performing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the covariance matrix of a pre-processed and normalized ratings matrix. I then conducted collaborative and content-based filtering via Pearson correlation between users and items respectively. In short, I reduced 100K-1M viewer’s preferences into a few dozen specific or sudo movie ratings that, when combined, can represent any given user’s preference. I then can predict the rating a new user would give to a movie they have not seen before by looking at seeing how the new user’s previous preferences relate to other viewer’s preferences who had seen the movie (i.e. the few dozen sudo movie ratings per movie).

                <br>
                <p id="content" class="wow animated fadeInUp"><b>(2016)</b> - The Commercial Airline Industry is dynamic, complex, and above all else a necessity to a great deal of individuals in today’s fast pace environments. Companies must constantly improve their understanding of their customers. Anticipating customer’s future needs are best approached by learning from historical desires and trends. This project aimed to utilize both business intelligence and machine learning strategies to provide tailored recommendations to the San Francisco International Airport (SFO). Recommendations where based on findings from their publicly available 2012-2013 customer surveys.
                    <br>
                    <br> In order to enhance customer experience and create the foundation for future business strategies, we first needed to conduct customer segmentation. I cleaned and pre-processed the customer surveys, extracting a plethora of questions relating to  aspects commonly used in customer segmentation such as demographics and usage patterns. Rather than a typical manual needs-based segmentation, I utilized unsupervised ML techniques to segment individuals into three groups. I tested various clustering techniques such as density-based and hierarchical clustering methods, but I found a simple K-Means clustering (k=3) to give interesting and insightful results. Mathematical methods to evaluate the quality of a clustering included calculating SSE and Silhouette Coefficients.

                    <br>
                    <br>Through a combination of Tableau and Watson Data Analytics, we investigated each groups distribution with relation to various statistics such as age distribution, income levels, airport destination market size, and many more. Our analysis showed that although SFO’s Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) services were being utilized by mostly male businessmen, female and casual travelers were not aware of such services. While BART was meant to release pressure from private or commercial vehicle usage in an environmentally friendly way, BART was not marketed as such or in areas where casual flyer's frequently visited (public parking, taxi drop-off locations, etc.). We recommended SFO set up an educational board to advertise BART in these locations as well as add updates via the SFO Wi-Fi portal.

                <p id="content" class="wow animated fadeInUp"><b>(2016)</b> - Abstract: Many organisms maintain collective territories and compete on behalf of the fitness of the overall group.
Inspired by this concept, the territorial raider model is a graph-based resource competition in which
populations have fixed home locations and a limited range of sites accessible for raiding. In our present
extension of the model, groups control “colonies” or “armies” which can be divided across multiple locations.
We present Nash equilibria for games played on both regular graphs and regular bipartite graphs, and we also
examine differences that emerge when populations are composed of discrete units (pack scale) or when they are
continuously divisible (colony scale). Reliance upon defense over aggressive raiding is greater here than in the
original model where populations had to totally commit to a singular action. This defensive posture increases
with the advantage of the local population and also varies with the degree of the graph's connectivity. When
discrete units are employed, multiple strategies emerge. <br />

                <p id="content" class="wow animated fadeInUp"><b>(2015)</b> - Abstract: A derangement of a graph G = (V, E) is an injective function f : V → V such that for
all v ∈ V, f(v) ̸= v and (v, f(v)) ∈ E. Not all graphs admit a derangement and previous
results have characterized graphs with derangements using neighborhood conditions for
subsets of V. We establish an alternative criterion for the existence of derangements on
a graph. We analyze strict Nash equilibria of the biologically motivated Territorial Raider
game, a multi-player competition for resources in a spatially structured population based
on animal raiding and defending behavior. We find that a graph G admits a derangement if
and only if there is a strict Nash equilibrium of the Territorial Raider game on G. <br />
